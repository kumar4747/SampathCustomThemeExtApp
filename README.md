# SampathCustomThemeExtApp
This is my custom theme sample ExtJS application implemented using SASS and Sencha Cmd. Generated custom theme named sam-custom-theme from ExtJS predefined theme i.e ext-theme-neptune. I have also modified application views styles using SASS variables and rules.

You can play with the live example @ below mentioned Sencha Fiddle
